  Welcome to uMailPHP. This program handles email templates. It can be a
  little tricky to set up, so read through these instructions carefully.

  <h3>How It Works</h3>
</div>
To use uMailPHP to its full potential, you must first know how it works.
This system constructs emails using three parts:
<ul>
  <li>The template.</li>
  <li>The mail definition.</li>
  <li>An optional custom redefinition called a rendition.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The <strong>template</strong> is used for each email that is sent. It
  provides the basic layout of the email. Any number of templates can be
    defined, but only the first one that is enabled will be used. If you don't
    define your own template, a default one will be used.
</p>
<p>
  The <strong>mail definition</strong> is provided by a class responsible for
  initiating the email. It provides the main content of the email. So, for
  example, the mail definition of an email sent when a new user registers
  would pertain to the user and provide their information in the body of the
  email. Whereas, the definition of an email sent when a user makes an online
  purchase would provide information about the purchase and a receipt.
</p>
<p>
  A <strong>rendition</strong>, when defined, is used in place of the mail
  definition to construct the body of the email. It can be created through
  this GUI to customize the email's content.

  <h3>How To Customize</h3>
</div>
<p>
  The two ways you can customize the emails are by creating templates and
  renditions. When you create a template, you can design the overall look and
  design of all emails. When you create a rendition, you can customize a
  single type of email (like a new user registration email).
</p>
<h4>Macros</h4>
<p>
  The content in an email almost always includes variables, such as the
  recipient's name, which are handled by macros. A macro is just the name of a
  variable surrounded by hash symbols (e.g. #to_name#). This text is replaced
  by the correct value before the email is sent.
</p>
<p>
  There are universal macros, which can be used in any template, definition,
  or rendition. Also, there are macros specific to a mail definition. For
  example, the definition of an email sent when a user changes an appointment
  with a customer may have macros called #old_date# and #new_date#. When you
  create a rendition to customize the email, you can use these macros.
</p>
<div class="well">
  <p>
    <span class="label label-warning">Heads Up</span>
    When you format a macro, edit the macro string as a whole. If you want
    to bold it, change the whole string, including the hash symbols.
